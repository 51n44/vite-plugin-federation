# Basic Rollup Module Federation Example

This repository is to showcase examples of how Module Federation can be used in rollup.

## Running Demo
Cd to each project, run `yarn build` and `yarn serve`. This will build and serve both `host` and `remote` projects:
- rollup-host: [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000/)
- rollup-remote: [localhost:5001](http://localhost:5001/)
